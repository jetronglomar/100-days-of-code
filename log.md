# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 22, 2021 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my portfolio and practicing my foundation on html and css.

**Thoughts:** Really excited to start this coding challenge and I've been stuck on a corporate setup where personally I think is limited for my skill growht. Decided to get out of my comfort zone and learn more things outside my current setup. That's why I decided to be commited on this challenge.

### Day 2: May 23, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the layout of the portfolio and typography.

**Thoughts**: Day 02 - this progress made my day! Grinning face with smiling eyes As a developer who works on backend most of the time, I'm happy to learn new stuffs like css grid. Looking forward on improving my portfolio.
